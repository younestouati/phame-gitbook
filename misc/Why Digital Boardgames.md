#Why Digital Boardgames?

The first thing to note, is that Phame is not an attempt at replacing traditional boardgames. NOGET. An important part of the appeal of boardgames is the NOGET and tactile nature. NOGET.



The vision of Phame is to be for board games what the Kindle was for books. That is, a platform that combines the best from an old, well known physical medium with the possibilities of the digital world, and as result creates a new medium which coexist with, supplements and and maybe event augments the physical counterpart.



The Kindle, and other ebook readers, haven’t killed traditional books or even come close (despite widespread predictions suggesting that it would). LOOK FOR STUDIES ABOUT EBOOKS VS TRADITIONAL BOOKS.

###Advantages of going digital

Whenever a medium is moved to the digital world, it opens up a plethora of possibilities. Board games are no exception. Some of these possibilities relate to how the games can be developed, distributed, sold and bought. Others have to do with the actual gameplay:

Production and distribution advantages of digital boardgames:

* **Easier distribution**: Digital board games don’t need to be printed. Since Phame is a web based framework, you’ll just need to host you game somewhere. At that point, distributing your game is as easy as sharing a link. Furthermore, you can embed your game on Facebook or elsewhere to be where your potential users already are.

* **Easier to go to new Markets**: Being distributed online, the game will be available all other the world - unless you actively prevent it. You may want to support different languages, but this won’t require printing of new games.

* **Easier to buy / access**: Just like digital games are easier to distribute for the creator, they are easier to obtain for the players. Trying out a new board game can suddenly be a Friday night impulse decision, when you don’t need to buy it at a store or wait for it to be delivered.

* **Lower Production Costs (maybe) => cheaper (maybe)**: Given that the game doesn’t need to be printed, it will probably be cheaper to develop and distribute. Of course, this entirely depends on how advanced you make your game. If you go full-NOGET on 3D graphics, professional sound effects etc it can be significantly more expensive to develop (time- and/or money-wise). 

* **Easier to test ** Digital games are easy to test during development as well as after they have been launched. Use A/B testing to compare different versions or ideas, and use automatically collected statistics to learn about user patterns that will help you improve and tweak your game.

* **Easier to store and bring with you**: Digital board games take up no space, and are easy to bring with you when traveling.

* **Easier to update**: Whether you need to fix and error or add a new feature or an expansion, updating digital board games is way easier than printing new physical games.

* **More distribution models**: Digital board games can be free, paid or subscription based. You can offer trial versions (limited in time people can play, number of players, features or other).

###Game Play / Features

* **Multimedia**: Use video, audio, 3D graphics, animations to create more engaging experiences and compelling story telling. Bring the best of modern computer games to your board games.

* **Save Games**: Games can easily be saved and continued later. No more having to finish a game because the dinner table needs to be used for something as trivial as dinner.

* **No setup**: You'll be ready to to play immediately.

No loss of cards / bricks	 etc.

…

* **Enforce the rules**: Make sure nobody cheats by accident or on purpose

* **Tutorial**: Offer instructions through video or interactive guides, rather than forcing the players to read a rule book before getting started. If only some of the players  are unfamiliar with the rules, you can offer only them  in-game help and guidance

* **Statistics**: Allow the players to collect and track statistics about their performance and automatic keep score of the NOGET between friends.

* **Always up to date**: A question/answer game for instance can pull the question from the Internet making sure they are always up-to-date. Also, use the correct-answer rate to determine the difficulty of the questions.

* **Real Time**: Most board games are turn based. Digital board games can certainly follow this model too, but they also make it very simple to mix in real time aspects. Have limited times where a user can perform a certain action or give everybody a fixed amount of time to prepare their armies before the great battle.

* **Mix in computer game features**: Example: A common theme in board games is to determine NOGET based on luck - typically by throwing dice. The outcome of a battle in RISK is determined this way. IN digital board games, you can make this decision skill based by turning the controller into a traditional NOGET controller, and have the players fight the fight, as NOGET.

* **Secret Communication between Players**: Allow people to do secret alliances by writing secret messages during the game. After the game, you could show a quick replay of the game augmented with this secret communication, thus revealing the secret alliances and double talk that happened unbeknownst to the other players.

* **Spy on other players**:
In a digital board game you can allow player A to spy on player B’s hand, without player A knowing about it. In general it is very easy to share information with a subset of the players with the other players knowing about it.

* **AI Players**: AI players can fill up the missing slots to make a game fun and playable. Or it can take over from a player who has to quit the game prematurely.

* **Level the playing field**:
Make games fun and playable for players of different level and background. Automatically select easier questions, or make the dice more kind towards kids, or make sure that players from different countries will get questions related to their own countries (or each others countries)/

Augmented reality (add this later!)

###Usage

Digital board games can be used for in many different ways

* Create games that would be hard or impossible to implement as traditional board games (.e.g. incorporate some of the features listed above)
* Make 1-to-1 digital version of a physical board game. You may want sell them together so people can play the physical version when at home, and the digital when they don’t have access to the physical version.
* Make augmented version of a physical game in which you make use 3D graphics, video, sound effects etc. to improve the experience.
* Use the digital board game as a prototype platform. Test and tweak your game, before you make the final physical version.




Why are digital boardgames not common?

Current models: async and pass-and-play and only shared state.

They kind of are (chess etc)

Not well with shared and secret state

Multidevice is hard and time-consuming when we go beyond quick prototype mode

Make the board game api useful even without Phame - for instance for shared-state-only-games



Phame - We’re gonna play forever!
